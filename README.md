# JS FP Functions from Scratch

Popular native JavaScript, lodash, and RxJS Array functions built from scratch for my personal educational purposes.

#### Functions built from scratch:
* forEach
* map
* filter
* concatAll
* zip

## FP Terminology
* **Projection** - Apply a function to a value creating a new value.
* **Predicate** - is a function that accepts an item in the array, and returns a boolean indicating whether the item should be retained in the new array.
